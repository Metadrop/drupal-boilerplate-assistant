# Drupal Boilerplate Assistant


This is simple Composer Plugin that is used by [Metadrop/drupal-boilerplate](https://github.com/Metadrop/drupal-boilerplate)
to setup the local Druapl site after creating using `composer create-project`.

You don't need this package unless another package is explicitly requiring it.
